## What is Folio?

Most PDF readers treat you like a filing cabinet. Open file. Read. Close.

Folio is different. It's a **desktop reading environment** built around the idea that reading shouldn't be a passive, lonely activity. You have a resident AI companion — **Lyra** — who reads alongside you. She can see the page you're on, discuss what you're reading, and she actually has opinions. Not the corporate hedging kind. Real ones.

It runs on your machine. Your books stay on your machine. Nothing phones home.

<br/>

<br/>

## Features

<br/>

### ✦ Lyra — an AI that reads with you

> *"No corporate AI energy. No 'As an AI...' garbage. Just sharp, direct, and actually useful."*

Lyra is your AI companion. She's not a chatbot bolted onto a PDF viewer. She's built into the reading experience:

- **She can see what you're reading** — sends the current page as an image when you ask (works on comics, diagrams, charts, anything visual)
- **Select any text → Ask Lyra** — highlight a sentence, click, and she's already on it
- **She has a real voice** — powered by ElevenLabs neural TTS, not robotic browser speech
- **Fully customizable persona** — rename her, rewrite her personality, make her whoever you need

<br/>

### 🖥 Runs completely local (or cloud — your choice)

| Provider | Models | Private | Cost |
|----------|--------|---------|------|
| **Ollama** | Llama 3.2, Mistral, DeepSeek R1, Phi-3... | ✅ 100% local | Free |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini | ☁ API | Pay-per-use |
| **Anthropic** | Claude Opus, Sonnet, Haiku | ☁ API | Pay-per-use |

No internet required if you use Ollama. Your books, your conversations, your data — all stay on your machine.

<br/>

### 📖 Reading experience

- **Eye-safe warm themes** — amber-toned paper and dark modes, no harsh blue light
- **5 highlight colors** — paint text, click to remove, persists per book
- **Remembers where you left off** — opens to your exact scroll position, every time
- **Comic/manga mode** — lazy-loads pages so it never lags, even on 400-page volumes
- **Focus mode** — strips every distraction, just text and Lyra
- **Fonts** — Lora, Georgia, system serif, monospace
- **Column width** — Narrow / Normal / Wide / Full

<br/>

### 🔊 Voice — ElevenLabs

Lyra can read her responses aloud. Neural voices, not the robotic browser fallback. Two voices built in, switchable in settings.
